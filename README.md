# ☀️ Solar Potential demo

## Description

This repository provides a sample app demonstrating use of the **[Solar API]**. The Solar API offers many benefits to solar marketplace websites, solar installers, and solar SaaS designers.

The demo app showcases and displays the information from the Solar API on a map.

## Requirements

To run the samples, you will need:

- To [sign up with Google Maps Platform]
- A Google Maps Platform [project] with the **Maps JavaScript and Solar APIs** enabled
- An [API key] associated with the project above
- Current version of Node.js and NPM

## Google Maps API key

Once you have your API key, update the [`.env`](.env) file with your key.

```sh
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Running the app

First, run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

### Developer mode

To start the app in developer mode, this allows hot-reloads.
This means that every time you change a file, the app reloads itself automatically.

```sh
# Run in developer mode.
npm run dev
```

### Production mode

Starting in developer mode enables a lot of useful tools while developing, but for a production version we first need to build the app.

```sh
# Build the app.
npm run build

# Start the app.
npm run start
```

## Deploying to Cloud Run

One option to deploy your app is with [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run).
It's easy to use and allows us to build and deploy scalable containerized apps written in any language on a fully managed platform.

For some languages like Node.js, it infers the configuration and can [deploy from source directly](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying-source-code), without any additional configurations!
This uploads your source, builds it with [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build), deploys it to Cloud Run, and starts the service with `npm run start`.
All with a single command.

```sh
# Choose the Cloud location to deploy the app.
export LOCATION="us-central1"

# Build and deploy the app from source.
gcloud run deploy "solar-potential" \
  --source="." \
  --region="$LOCATION" \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

## Checking your code

You can use `npm run check` to do type checking and check for other common issues.
You can also use `npm run check:watch` to continuously check your code when you save your changes.

To check for styling and formatting issues, you can use `npm run lint`.
To fix any lint issues, use `npm run format` to automatically format all the code base.
